The workshop's start time.
The workshop's duration.
The workshop's end time.
struct Available_Workshops having the following members:

An integer,  (the number of workshops the student signed up for).
An array of type Workshop array having size .
Implement  functions:

Available_Workshops* initialize (int start_time[], int duration[], int n) 
Creates an Available_Workshops object and initializes its elements using the elements 
in the duration[] and start_time[] parameters (both are of size ). 
Here, start_time[] and duration[] are the respective start time and duration for the workshop. 
This function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.

int CalculateMaxWorkshops(Available_Workshops* ptr) 
Returns the maximum number of workshops the student can attendâ€”without overlap. 
The next workshop cannot be attended until the previous workshop ends.
